# QSTN
QSTN is a Python framework designed to facilitate the creation of robust inference experiments with Large Language Models based around questionnaires. It provides a full pipeline from perturbation of prompts, to choosing Response Generation Methods, inferencing and finally parsing of the output. QSTN supports both local inference with vllm and remote inference via the OpenAI API.
